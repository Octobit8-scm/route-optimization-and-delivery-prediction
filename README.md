# route-optimization-and-delivery-prediction
## Overview
Route optimization and delivery prediction are critical in the transportation and logistics industry to reduce operational costs, improve delivery times, and enhance customer satisfaction.
## Objective: 
- Optimize delivery routes to minimize costs and ensure timely deliveries.
## Data Sources
-	GPS data from delivery vehicles.
-	Real-time traffic data.
-	Delivery logs and performance records.
-	Weather data and road maps.
## Implementation Steps
### 1.	Data Collection
-	Gather real-time traffic and GPS data from vehicle tracking systems.
-	Collect historical delivery data and performance metrics.
### 2.	Data Preprocessing
-	Clean GPS coordinates and remove inaccuracies.
-	Handle missing or incorrect traffic data.
-	Normalize data for consistent analysis.
### 3.	Feature Engineering
-	Create features like:
    - Traffic conditions on planned routes.
    - Delivery deadlines and priorities.
    - Distance between stops and expected travel time.
### 4.	Optimization Algorithms
-	Implement route optimization techniques, such as:
     - Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm: For finding the shortest path between two points.
     - A Search Algorithm*: For efficient route planning with constraints.
     - Reinforcement Learning: For dynamic route adjustments based on real-time data.
### 5.	Deployment
-	Integrate the optimized routing model into the fleet management system.
-	Enable real-time updates for drivers via mobile or onboard devices.
### 6.	Monitoring and Maintenance
-	Track delivery performance metrics like on-time delivery rate and cost per mile.
-	Continuously refine routing strategies with updated traffic and delivery data.
## Tools and Technologies
#### Python: 
- Libraries like Google OR-Tools for optimization and pandas for data manipulation.
#### SQL: 
- For querying and managing delivery and traffic data.
#### AWS Lambda: 
- For real-time routing and serverless deployment.
